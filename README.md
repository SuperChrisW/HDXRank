# HDXRank
HDXRank is an open-source pipeline to apply HDX-MS restraints to protein-protein complex integrative docking

## Motivation:
Integrating sparse experimental data into protein docking workflows can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of complex model predictions. There is currently no standard integrative docking protocol that effectively incorporates hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) data, which provides valuable insights into protein binding interfaces. Inspired by advances in graph-based deep learning for protein representation, we presented a docking scoring framework that re-ranks protein-protein complex models based on their alignment with experimentally observed HDX profiles, offering a robust, HDX-informed docking protocol to improve docking accuracy.
